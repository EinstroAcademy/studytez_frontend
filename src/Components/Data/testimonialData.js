      "My experience with Einstro Study Abroad has been nothing short of great. From shortlisting universities to securing scholarships, they were prompt and patient throughout the process. We were guided really well, and I had my visa for the United Kingdom in hand within 2 weeks (standard processing time). Their team and system are well-built, and and though there were minor delays in communication, they delivered and obtained my visa on time. I highly recommend Einstro Study Abroad if youâ€™re looking to study abroad!",
